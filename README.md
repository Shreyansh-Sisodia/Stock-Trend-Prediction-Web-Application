# Stock-Trend-Prediction-Web-Application

This is a web-based application built using Python, Streamlit, Keras, pandas, and matplotlib that predicts the stock price of a company using historical stock market data. The application utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for stock price prediction and compares the predicted price with the actual price, displaying the results in an interactive graphical interface.
# How It Works
1. The application fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance based on the stock ticker entered by the user.
2. The data is visualized in various forms (closing price, moving averages).
3. The LSTM model, trained on past stock data, predicts future stock prices.
4. The predictions are displayed alongside the actual prices, allowing users to evaluate the model's performance.
